# 💘 Speed Dating EDA

An exploratory data analysis of speed dating behavior patterns, examining what drives attraction, connection, and follow-up interest between potential partners. This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset from experimental speed dating events (2002-2004) to uncover insights about dating preferences and social dynamics.

## 📊 Key Findings & Analysis

### Match Rate Patterns
- Comprehensive analysis of match rates by demographic factors (age, gender, goals)
- Investigation of how participants' stated intentions influence their dating success
- Statistical breakdown of what makes people more likely to get matches

### Partner Preferences vs. Reality
- Comparison between what people *say* they want in a partner and what they actually choose
- Gender differences in rating different attributes (attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, shared interests)
- Analysis of how accurately people can predict what others find attractive

### Self-Perception vs. Peer Evaluation
- Radar chart visualizations comparing self-ratings with how others perceive participants
- Gender-based differences in self-awareness and social perception
- Insights into dating market value and self-assessment accuracy

### Timing & Sequence Effects
- Investigation of whether the order of speed dates affects outcomes
- Analysis of fatigue effects and first/last date advantages
- Temporal patterns in decision-making throughout the evening

## 🎯 Research Questions Explored

- What are the most/least desirable attributes in male vs. female partners?
- How important is attractiveness compared to other factors in actual decision-making?
- Are shared interests more influential than demographic similarities?
- Can people accurately predict their own dating market value?
- Does the sequence of dates (first vs. last of the night) impact success rates?

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This analysis goes beyond simple dating statistics to explore fundamental questions about:
- **Perception vs. Reality**: How our stated preferences differ from our actual choices
- **Social Bias**: How gender, age, and background influence dating decisions  
- **Self-Awareness**: How accurately we assess our own attractiveness and value
- **Behavioral Economics**: How context and timing affect human decision-making

The visualizations emphasize clarity and storytelling, making complex social dynamics accessible and actionable.

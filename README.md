# 💘 Speed Dating EDA

This notebook explores behavioral patterns and preferences in a speed dating dataset, using thoughtful visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover what drives attraction, connection, and follow-up interest.

# 📊 What’s Inside

Preliminary statistics and visualizations, match rates by goal, gender, and age => in order to understand how participants’ intentions and demographics influence their likelihood of getting a match.

Partner preferences & guesses compare how men and women rate different attributes in potential partners—and how accurately they guess what others value.

Self vs. peer evaluation dive into radar charts showing how participants perceive themselves versus how others perceive them, split by gender.

Timing effects explore whether the order of speed dates affects the chances of getting a second date.

# 🧠 Why It Matters

This EDA isn’t just about dating—it’s about perception, bias, and social dynamics. The visualizations aim to be accessible, reproducible, and insightful, with a focus on clarity and storytelling.
